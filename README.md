Denial_of_Service_Attack
========================

Simple Client Server DOS Attack

Initially we created two clients and a server.
Two clients request the server and server automatically replies to it.
Later on when one of the clients attacks the server, server stops replying to all the clients.

Then finally we could detect and prevent the attack.
Here we used a sniffer to detect the attack. And then used counter based algorithm to prevent the attack.
